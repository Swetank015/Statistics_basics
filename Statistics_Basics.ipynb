However, covariance by itself does not provide information about the strength of this relationship because it is not normalized.\n",

        "- **Correlation**: The correlation between height and weight is approximately \\( r = 0.994 \\), which is very close to +1. This indicates a **very strong positive linear relationship** between the two variables. As height increases, weight increases in a very consistent manner. A correlation close to +1 suggests that the variables are highly linearly related.\n",

        "\n",
        "- The **covariance** of 52 shows that height and weight tend to vary together, with higher values of height associated with higher values of weight.\n",
